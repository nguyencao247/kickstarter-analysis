# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This project provides an analysis of crowdfunding data to determine what makes a successful fundraising campaign for plays.My findings will provide Louise better insight on Kickstarting her play’s (Fever) fundraising campaign.
## Findings
An overview of parent categories show that fundraisers for theater related projects have the highest number of successful outcomes.

The most successful Kickstarter campaigns were started in May. On the other hand, December doesn't seem like a great time to launch a campaign.

Failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns.

Given that Louise is asking for $12,000 for her project, this is more than twice the average successful Kickstarter goal, so this isn't great news for her campaign.

The mean and median of failed pledged amounts are much lower than the successful pledges, which indicates that failed Kickstarter campaigns are unsuccessful for reasons other than asking for too much money.If the failed projects were also getting a median pledge amount of around $3,000, it's possible that those that failed just asked for too high of a price. Since the median is much lower, there must be another factor keeping people from pledging to those unsuccessful projects.

The mean of each distribution is around the 3rd quartile, so the data follows similar distributions in each subset.The standard deviations are larger than the mean, which means everything below the mean is considered "close" to the center. Some large values are driving all of these distributions. The standard deviations are all roughly twice the IQR in each distribution, except in the failed Kickstarters, where the standard deviation is closer to three times the IQR. There must be some failed Kickstarters with really high goals!

Looking forward to her future project (a musical), Louis estimates she’ll need £4,000.

The box plot below shows a distribution of campaign goals and the distribution of total amounts pledged for plays in Great Britain. From these plots, we can see that the mean campaign goal is around £4,000. This is outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged, so Louise should probably try to get her play produced for less than £4,000. Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.

## Recommendations
Here are my recommendations to Louise for a successful fundraising campaign for her upcoming play: Fever. 
1.	Louise should lower her goal amount from $12,000 to $5,000. This is within the mean of goals that were successful. Asking for too much money will increase her chances of a failed campaign. 
2.	Louise should plan her campaign between May and June. These months had the most successful outcomes. 
3.	Regarding her other project in Great Britain, Louise should also reduce her goal from £4,000 to £2,000. This is way above the mean, but still do-able since half of the pledge amounts are less than £2,000.
